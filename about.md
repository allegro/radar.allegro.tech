# How to Use Allegro Tech Radar

<article>

## Understand the Quadrants

- **Languages** – Controls programming language diversity to align with hiring and maintenance strategy.
- **Framework & Tools** – Lists of frameworks, libraries, and tools Allegro invests in for productivity and
  maintainability.
- **Databases & Infra** – Covers foundational services and PaaS components critical for scalability and stability.
- **Techniques & Tools** – Highlights good practices, methodologies, and organizational/technical approaches.

> Quadrants only group items; they don’t change the evaluation process.

## Learn the Rings

Each technology is placed into one of four rings that show its maturity and adoption status at Allegro:

- **Adopt** – Safe, reliable, and supported. Can be used in production and critical services.
- **Trial** – Validated through assessment, currently expanding usage. Usable in production, but support is limited.
- **Assess** – Under evaluation with high risk. Can only be used within controlled assessments with explicit approval.
- **Hold** – Deprecated or in decommission. Must not be used in new projects; requires a replacement plan.

Items not yet tracked are considered **Off Radar** and may be proposed for assessment by becoming an Item Owner.

## Follow the Assessment & Trial Process

### Assessment

- Item Owner prepares a plan with:
    - Rationale (a problem being solved)
    - Alternatives analysis
    - Evaluation criteria
    - Community discussion (Slack/Discourse)
- Assessment must be time-bound and approved by Tech Radar Owners.
- If criteria are not met, the item goes **Off Radar** or to the **Hold** ring.

### Trial

- A broader adoption phase with limited support.
- Requires a plan that defines:
    - Criteria for proving usefulness
    - Steps to evaluate success
    - Support strategy if moving toward Adopt

## Apply in Practice

- **When choosing tech**: Check quadrant and ring placement, then read item-specific notes.
- **When proposing new tech**: Become an Item Owner, follow the assessment checklist, and involve the community.
- **When decommissioning tech**: Ensure a clear replacement plan exists and is aligned with the Hold ring guidelines.
