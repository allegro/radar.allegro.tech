OpenTelemetry (OTel) is a standard for telemetry data formats as well as a collection of zero-code integrations, APIs, SDKs and tools used for instrumenting, generating, collecting and querying telemetry data: metrics, logs and traces. For the time being, we intend to use OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing only.
