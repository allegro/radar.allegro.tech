GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a server-side runtime that allows clients to request exactly the data they need
in a single request. Created by Facebook in 2012 and open-sourced in 2015, GraphQL was developed to address the
limitations of traditional REST APIs, particularly the problems of overfetching data and requiring multiple API calls
for mobile applications.
