Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a suite of public cloud computing services offered by Google. Our usage focuses on specific Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offerings, primarily compute (Google Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Functions) and networking (VPC, Cloud Interconnect) components, alongside managed databases ( Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL).
